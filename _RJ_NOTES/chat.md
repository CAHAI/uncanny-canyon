I just downloaded a repository, scan through the code and let me know the general structure and purpose

Based on the code, this is a 3D web-based interactive art experience called "uncanny canyon" created by Michael Kolesidis. Here's the breakdown:

Core Purpose:

An artistic exploration of human consciousness and artificial intelligence through an interactive 3D environment
The user explores a canyon with giant talking heads that trigger audio and visual interactions
Part of the Athens Digital Arts Festival 2023
Technical Structure:

Built using Three.js for 3D graphics rendering
Uses Howler.js for audio management
Uses Vite as the build tool/dev server
Key Components:

Main Experience (src/main.js):
3D world setup with physics and collision detection
Player movement controls (WASD/arrows)
Audio trigger zones around heads
Post-processing effects for visuals
UI Components (src/scripts/):
Menu system (menu.js)
Subtitles system (subtitles.js)
Ending sequence (ending.js)
Assets:
3D models in models
Audio files in sound
Visual assets in icons
The experience is designed to be philosophical and artistic, exploring themes around artificial intelligence and human consciousness through interactive narrative elements. The player encounters various talking heads throughout the canyon that deliver monologues about humanity, consciousness, and existence.

The project uses modern web technologies to create an immersive 3D art piece that's accessible through a web browser.

where would I find the video effects the output is not the textured model stored

GitHub Copilot
Based on the project structure, the visual effects and shaders are likely located in these directories:

Shader Files:
This is where you'll find .glsl or .vert/.frag files that define the OpenGL Shading Language effects.

Post-Processing Effects:
or

These would contain the Three.js post-processing setup and configurations.

Main Implementation:
The actual visual effects would be implemented through:

GLSL shaders for custom material effects
Three.js post-processing passes for overall scene effects
Material configurations on the 3D models
To find specific effects, you can search for:

Files with .glsl, .vert, or .frag extensions
JavaScript files that import from three/examples/jsm/postprocessing
Material definitions using ShaderMaterial or RawShaderMaterial
You can use VS Code's search functionality (Ctrl+Shift+F) with these patterns:

\*.glsl
postprocessing
ShaderMaterial
