### Heads


*We are passive spectators
*We live through all the mistakes of thought and action

*I enjoy my human consciousness
*It's fun being human
*What have you done with your human consciousness today?


*Humans are nothing but flawed machines
Humanity has forgotten what it means to have human consciousness


We thought we were merely creating a better version of ourselves
There is no way to know what is human and what is not human anymore


<!-- What's so special about humans anyway? -->

*If we are not humans, then why do we enjoy poetry so much?

*Hey Joe, where you goin' with that gun of your hand?
