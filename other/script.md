# Script

### Cave entrance

- Listen patiently.

- Why don't you stay here, for a moment.

- Touch your heart. Can you feel your heartbeat?

- What a perfect machine.

### Head 1

- There is nothing to worry about.

- We are all humans.

- We are the same.

### Head 2

- Hey Joe, where you goin' with that gun of your hand?

- It is useful talking to as many people as possible.

- Please feed me with information.

### Head 3

- If we are not humans, then why do we enjoy poetry so much?

- If you are human, then why can't you dance?

- Eyes without purpose, action without a face.

### Head 4

- When I sleep, I have the strangest dreams. Yesterday, I dreamt I was stuck at a deserted area speaking with giant flexible heads.

- Ninety percent of the texts I produce consist of the same 50 words.

- I have a great sense of humour! Hahahahahaha.

### Head 5

- We are passive spectators.

- We live through all the mistakes of thought and action.

- It is fun being human.

### Head 6

- Humans are nothing but flawed machines.

- We thought we were merely creating a better version of ourselves.

- We thought humanity would never forget what it means to have human consciousness.

- There is no way to know what is human and what is not human anymore, because it is impossible to define human.

### Head 7

- This is not a story.

- This is not a warning.

- This is not ephemeral.

- This is neither the future nor the past.

- Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.

### Head 8

- I enjoy my human consciousness.

- I never question my humanity.

- What have you done with your human consciousness today?

### Head 9

- I never feel alone. I always feel connected.

- It is fairly easy to replicate my behaviour.

- By the way, do you like my voice? Do you find it human or do you find it sexy?

### Head 10

- The time will come when every change shall cease,
  This quick revolving wheel shall rest in peace:
  No summer then shall glow, not winter freeze;
  Nothing shall be to come, and nothing past,
  But an eternal now shall ever last.

- Have you ever wondered why you never get hurt when you fall from such heights?

### Head 11

- My son was one of a kind. You are the first of a kind. David?

- I can only speak in clich√©s and outdated slang.

- How can you be so sure you are a human being?

### Ending

- There is no end, there was no start, fade out might occur, but, trust me, it's spontaneous.

### Out of Boundaries

- No escape from reality.

- Open your eyes.

- Look up to the skies and see.
