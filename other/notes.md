It is set in a black and white world, in a deserted, unfamiliar location. A rocky canyon dominats the setting. A dozen giant, humanoid, flexible heads are scattered throughout the location on fixed positions. They have some words to share with use.

Do they form a story? Are they a warning? Are the personal? Could they be personal? Does anything emerge out of this concurrence of a multiplicity of fragmented narratives?

First person perspective is used. Time appears to be passing fast. The players/spectators control an unseen character. The character is the only human around. Maybe the last human. It appears to have special abilities: jump high, fall from heights, never get hurt, all these without making any sound or noise. Are we really human? Do we still remember what it means to be human in order to be able to answer? Do we still remember what it means to have human consciousness? Are we the perfect machine, the perfect human? These are some of the questions the experience aims to pose.

It's purpose is not the elucidation

The work attempts to explore the perception and the multifaceted relationship between human consciousness and artificial intelligence, the reciprocal

It explores the reciprocal relationship between the technologically canonical and the new, by taking the familiar form of a first-person game, a vestigial flicker of nostalgia, while confronting the player a synecdochical representation of robots, in the form of the humanoid heads. They appear to be realistic, but also unrealistically flexible, thus excluded from the realm of knowable forms.

which are thereby excluded from the realm of knowable objects

simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the hyperreal

Is there a last human? Can we still distinguish between humans and machines? Can we still define humaness?

hyperreality is the inability to distinguish "The Real" (a term borrowed from Jacques Lacan) from the signifier of it.

The protagonist, the character, us
we are the last human

are we really human?
do we still remember what it means to be human?
do we still remember what it means to have human consciousness?
are we the perfect machine, the perfect human?
