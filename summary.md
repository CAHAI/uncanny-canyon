# Summary

uncanny canyon is a 3D web experience, an interactive spatiotemporal poem.

It is set in a black and white world, in a deserted, unfamiliar location. A rocky canyon dominated the setting. A dozen giant, humanoid, flexible heads are scattered throughout the location on fixed positions. They have some words to share with use. Do they form a story? Are they a warning? Are the personal? Could they be personal? Does anything emerge out of this concurrence of a multiplicity of fragmented narratives?

First person perspective is used. Time appears to be passing fast. The players/spectators control an unseen character. The character is the only human around. Maybe the last human. It appears to have special abilities: jump high, fall from heights, never get hurt, all these without making any sound or noise. Are we really human? Do we still remember what it means to be human in order to be able to answer? Do we still remember what it means to have human consciousness? Are we the perfect machine, the perfect human? These are some of the questions the experience aims to pose.

uncanny canyon is an exploration of the uncoscious mind: of the suppressed feelings, auto reactions and phobias that shape our multifaceted relation and perception of modern technology. It explores the reciprocal relationship between the technologically canonical and the new, by taking the familiar form of a first-person 3D game, a vestigial flicker of nostalgia from the late 90s - early 00s, while confronting the player a synecdochical representation of robots, in the form of the humanoid heads. They appear t o ne realistic, but also unrealistically flexible, thus
excluded from the realm of knowable forms.

but unrealistically flexible humanoids, robotic heads

which are thereby excluded from the realm of knowable objects

simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the hyperreal

hyperreality is the inability to distinguish "The Real" (a term borrowed from Jacques Lacan) from the signifier of it.

The protagonist, the character, us
we are the last human
appear to have special abilities, jump high, fakk from heights, doesn't get hurt, doesn't make any sound or noise
are we really human?
do we still remember what it means to be human?
do we still remember what it means to have human consciousness?
are we the perfect machine, the perfect human?

The name is a play on words because it is similar to the concept of the uncanny valley.
